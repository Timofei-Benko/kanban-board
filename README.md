# Kanban Board
## A board to keep track of your tasks

Watch it live here:
https://timofei-benko.github.io/kanban-board/

Things you can do:
1. Add cards
2. Edit cards (if they are not in Done)
3. Move cards across 3 columns (To do, In progress and Done)
3. Don't worry about quiting the site, your cards will be saved! Just make sure not to clear browser cache ;)
4. Use it on mobile devices

Things you can't do (may be added in the future):
1. Drag-n-drop cards
2. Add your own custom columns
3. Sign up
4. Use the site collaboratively (it implies adding the registration and the functionality for adding comments and storing data on the server instead of browser's local storage)
